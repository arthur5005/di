Uninterrupt my work, Digitally Imported
================================

This is a script for Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey/etc that auto-closes the [di.fm](http://www.di.fm/ "Digitally Imported") ad dialog box that interrupts the stream every so often requiring you to acknolwedge having seen an ad for 10 seconds. Having to do this makes it impossible to enjoy DI at work guilt free (seriously, who has the time to stare at an ad?). It still requires waiting 10 seconds before the stream continues, but this script will allow you to conitnue to work without the need to switch tabs and idle wastefully for 10 seconds.
